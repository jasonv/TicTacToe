Tic Tac Toe
===========

A console implementation of Tic Tac Toe with an unbeatable computer player.


Setup
-----

Checkout the TicTacToe project from github.com/jasonv98 into your local workspace folder for eclipse.  


Run Test Cases
--------------

The test cases prove that the AiWikipedia A.I. is unbeatable.  The CountNumberOfLosses class systemically plays every possible game of TicTacToe against a given A.I. and counts the number of losses.  We can see that AiWikipedia yields zero losses and the others loose sometimes.


Play Against The A.I.
---------------------

To play against the computer, run com.jasonv.tictactoe.TextAIUI.


Play With Another Person
------------------------

To play with another person and alternate turns, run com.jasonv.tictactoe.TextUI.
